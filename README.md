	Folders description:
  
	FIRMWARE - source code that must be complied in [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/#ide), and pre-compiled binary files in *.hex format, ready to be uploaded on to property board via "AvrDude", ["GA_Flasher"](https://github.com/afch/GA_Flasher) or any other software for flashing Atmega.
  
	LIBRARIES - Arduino libraries without which compiling will be failed. That folders must be copied to Arduino LIBRARIES folder, (default path: C:\Users\USER_NAME\Documents\Arduino\libraries)
